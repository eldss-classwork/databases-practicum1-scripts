## Creating Database Tables

Should you wish to inspect the scripts that create the database and populate data, they can be found at:

https://github.com/eldss-classwork/databases-practicum1-scripts

The following images will show a progression from an empty database through table creation in MySQL Workbench.

The MySQL Workbench start screen.

## Populating The Database

The script for populating data into our database can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/eldss-classwork/databases-practicum1-scripts/blob/master/populate.sql

Demonstrations that the data was loaded correctly can be found in the queries below. That is, they return the data that was loaded.

## Queries

The script for running all of the queries can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/eldss-classwork/databases-practicum1-scripts/blob/master/queries.sql

The following is the screenshots of the query results.
